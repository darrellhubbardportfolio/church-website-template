# church-website-template
a simple basic church website featuring some administrative features like creating events, meetings, sermons. this version will include podcasts, but no live streaming.
### prayer rooms
a feature only for authenticated users to access. every room has a maximum of upto 18 persons because i am using peer library; if it were going to hold more then i'd need to use a library like mediasoup. moving forwards, each prayer room wil tell the client how many seats left and total in each room as the administrator/creator can limit seats lower than 18. It gives back a start date and time. Not too concerned about location yet. I may give the option for a client to make a prayer meeting online or at a location later on.
